## Connectors & Amperage

_Note: All amperage-values have been designed to work in an enclosed printer with up to 65Â° chamber temperature & have  some safety margins. While you could use higher ampere in an open-frame printer, it's highly discouraged. <br/>
When multiple connectors are supported **bold** marks the recommended connector._
